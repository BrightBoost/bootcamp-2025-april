# 🧩 Build Your Own Breakout Room — Hackathon Challenge

This is a hackathon where your group **creates** the breakout room experience. At the end of the day, you'll present and let other teams try to "escape" your room.

## 🛠 What You’ll Use

You can combine **any skills you’ve learned so far**, including:

✅ Java (console apps using Scanner)
✅ SQL (queries against Sakila or custom databases)
✅ Optional: CSVs or small JSON files
✅ Optional: Creative use of ASCII art or emoji in the console
✅ Optional: Sound effects or timing via Java (only if you want)

## 🧱 Structure (Suggested, Not Mandatory)

* **Intro Prompt**: Start with a story — why are the players trapped? What’s at stake? (silly or serious!)
* **Stages**: Design 3–5 puzzles or riddles.
* **Puzzle types can include:**

  * Text-based riddles (logic or trivia)
  * SQL code puzzles (e.g. “Find the name of the only actor with 20+ films in the ‘Animation’ category”)
  * Java logic puzzles (e.g. math ciphers, Caesar shift, sorting challenge)
  * Inventory clues (search `film`, `rental`, or `actor` tables for the right values)
  * Hidden messages, secret codes, word scrambles, or console-based mazes

## 🧙 Tips for Teams

* Assign roles (Java developer, SQL wizard, story designer, tester)
* Keep it console-based and focus on clarity and fun
* Use color/ASCII if you want to make it pretty
* Store hints or codes in the database or output of a query
* Write clear instructions for the players trying your game

## 📦 Submission Checklist

✅ A fully working Java console app that runs your escape experience  
✅ If using SQL: scripts or setup notes for any custom tables
✅ Instructions for how to play (either printed or shown in-app)
✅ A fun, creative storyline and clear stages
✅ Optional: scoring, time limits, or easter eggs 🥚
