## 🔁 **Looping & Arrays – Java Exercises**

---

### 🟢 **Level 1: Loops with basic arrays (int, String)**

---

### ✅ **1. Print numbers with a for loop**
Create an `int[]` with values `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.  
Use a `for` loop to print each number.

---

### ✅ **2. Count backwards with a while loop**
Use a `while` loop to print numbers from 5 to 1.

---

### ✅ **3. Greet each person**
Create a `String[]` with names: `{"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}`.  
Use a `for` loop to print: `"Hello, [name]!"` for each.

---

### ✅ **4. Calculate the total**
Create an `int[]` with `{3, 5, 7, 2, 8}`.  
Use a `for` loop to calculate and print the **sum**.

---

### ✅ **5. Print only even numbers**
Use a `for` loop to print only even numbers from `{4, 7, 10, 15, 18}`.

---

### ✅ **6. Stop at a certain value (while loop)**
Given an array `{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}`, use a `while` loop to print values until you hit `7` (don't print 7).

---

### ✅ **7. Ask until valid input (do-while)**
Ask the user to enter a password using `Scanner`.  
Keep asking using a `do-while` loop until they enter `"secret123"`.

---

### 🟡 **Level 2: Arrays with calculations, conditions, combinations**

---

### ✅ **8. Count how many times "Java" appears**
Create a `String[]` with values: `{"Java", "Python", "Java", "C#", "Java"}`  
Use a `for` loop to count how many times `"Java"` appears.

---

### ✅ **9. Find the largest number**
Given `int[] numbers = {12, 5, 90, 34, 7}`, use a loop to find and print the largest number.

---

### ✅ **10. Compare two arrays**
Create two `int[]` arrays: `{1, 2, 3}` and `{1, 2, 4}`  
Use a `for` loop to check if they are **equal** (element by element). Print `true` or `false`.

---

### ✅ **11. Challenging: Copy one array to another**
Use a `for` loop to copy all values from array A into array B.  
Start with:  
```java
int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4};  
int[] b = new int[a.length];
```

---

### ✅ **12. Reverse an array**
Use a `for` loop to print the contents of an `int[]` in reverse order.  
Input: `{10, 20, 30}` → Output: `30 20 10`

---

### 🔵 **Level 3: Arrays of objects (like Book[])**

---

### ✅ **13. Create and loop through an array of `Book` objects**
Create a `Book` class with `title` and `author`.  
Then in `main`, create an array of 3 books and use a loop to print each book's title.

---

### ✅ **14. Count books by a certain author**
Use a `for` loop to count how many books were written by `"Alice"` in a `Book[]`.

---

### ✅ **15. Print books with more than X pages**
Add `int pages` to the `Book` class.  
Loop through a `Book[]` and print the titles of books that have more than 300 pages.
