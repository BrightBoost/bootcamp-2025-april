5. **String Contains "Java"**
   - Ask for a sentence and check if it contains the word ‚ÄúJava‚Äù.

6. **Are They Equal?**

   - Ask for a string and print it in reverse using `StringBuilder`.

11. **Convert String to Integer**
   - Ask for a number as a string (e.g., "123") and convert it to an `int`. Multiply by 2 and print the result.

12. **Safe Conversion with Try-Catch**
   - Try converting a string to an integer. If it fails, print `"Invalid number"`.

13. **Extract the Day from a Date**
   - Ask for a date in format `"2025-04-16"` and print the day (16). Use `substring()`.

14. **Is It a Palindrome?**
   - Ask for a word and check if it‚Äôs the same forwards and backwards.

15. **Split Full Name**

16. **Static Method: Greet Formally**
   - Write a static method `greetFormally(String name)` that returns: `"Hello, Ms./Mr. [NAME]"`.

17. **Capitalize First Letter Only**
   - Ask for a lowercase name (e.g., `"ada"`) and return `"Ada"`.

18. **Censor a Word**
   - Ask for a sentence and a "bad word". Replace the bad word with `***`.

   - Ask for three words and use `StringBuilder` to form a sentence like:  
     `"You said: [word1] [word2] [word3]."`
