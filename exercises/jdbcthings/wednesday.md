Create a Language model (just a class) with an id and a name + getters, setters, constructors.

I want you to create a LanguageDAO with the following methods:
- getAll
- getById
- getByName

In this DAO: no printing, no prompting. Very general class

Then, create an app. The app allows to get all the languages and print them.
Get all the languages and print them reversed.
Get a language by name. 
Get a language by id.
Exit app.
