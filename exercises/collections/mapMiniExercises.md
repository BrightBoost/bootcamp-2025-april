### ðŸ”¹ **1. HashMap with `String` â†’ `String`**

#### ðŸ§  Concept: Simple key-value mapping  
You're creating a small dictionary of words and their meanings.

#### âœ… Step-by-step:
1. Create a HashMap where the key is a word (String) and the value is its definition (also a String).
2. Add three words and their meanings to the map.
3. Retrieve and print the meaning of one specific word.
4. Replace the meaning of one of the words.
5. Check if a certain word exists in the map.
6. Print all keys (the words).
7. Print all values (the meanings).

### ðŸ”¹ **2. HashMap with `String` â†’ `Integer`**

#### ðŸ§  Concept: Storing quantities or numerical values  
You want to store names of people and their ages.

#### âœ… Step-by-step:

#### ðŸ§  Concept: One-to-many relationship  
Some people have more than one pet.

### ðŸ”¹ **5. HashMap with `Person` â†’ `List<Pet>`**

#### ðŸ§  Concept: Mapping custom objects to lists  
Now you want to store actual `Person` objects (with name + age) as keys.

#### âœ… Step-by-step:
1. Create a `Person` class with name and age.
2. Create a HashMap where the key is a `Person` and the value is a list of `Pet` objects.
3. Add 2 persons and their pets.
4. Retrieve the list of pets for a specific person and print them.
5. Add a new pet to one of the persons.
6. Loop through all entries in the map and print something like:  
   `"Person: [name], Age: [age] has pets: [pet list]"`

#### ðŸ§  Concept: Mapping one group to another  
You now want to map a group of people to the pets they jointly own (e.g., roommates).

#### âœ… Step-by-step:
1. Create a list of two `Person` objects to represent a household.
2. Create a list of pets they share.
