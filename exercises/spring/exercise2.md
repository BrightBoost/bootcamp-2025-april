1. Continue from your previous project
2. Create the endpoints for getting actors: getting all, get by id and get by name
    - Please mind: You can't have actors/{id} and actors/{name}, so use some different mapping for name endpoint
3. Create the endpoint for adding a new actor
4. Test your endpoints, for postman see workbook page 116 and on
