## Spring Boot - Get all languages

- Start a new Spring Boot project
- Add the web dependency 
- Generate the project and import it in intellij
- Add the apache and mysql depencencies from last week

Then:
- Create a model for language (look at the columns in the database)
- Create a DAO for language + datasource config 
- Add two methods: one for getting all languages, one for getting a language by id
- Create a controller and add two endpoints: one /language and one /language/{id}
